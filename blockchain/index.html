            <h2 class="title">What is Blockchain?</h2>
            <pre class="explanation">
Information held on a blockchain exists as a shared, and continually reconciled, database.
This is a way of using the network that has obvious benefits. The blockchain database
isn't stored in any single location, meaning the records it keeps are truly public and easily
verifiable. No centralized version of this information exists for a hacker to corrupt.
Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone on the internet. 

"The traditional way of sharing documents with collaboration is to send a Microsoft Word document
to another recipient, and ask them to make revisions to it. The problem with that scenario is that
you need to wait until receiving a return copy before you can see or make other changes because
you are locked out of editing it until the other person is done with it. That's how databases work
today. Two owners can't be messing with the same record at once.That's how banks maintain money
balances and transfers; they briefly lock access (or decrease the balance) while they make a
transfer, then update the other side, then re-open access (or update again).With Google Docs 
(or Google Sheets), both parties have access to the same document at the same time, and the single
version of that document is always visible to both of them. It is like a shared ledger, but it is
a shared document. The distributed part comes into play when sharing involves a number of people.
Imagine the number of legal documents that should be used that way. Instead of passing them to
each other, losing track of versions, and not being in sync with the other version, why can't *all*
business documents become shared instead of transferred back and forth? So many types of legal
contracts would be ideal for that kind of workflow.You don't need a blockchain to share documents,
but the shared documents analogy is a powerful one."
